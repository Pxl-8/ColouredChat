Brand new quasi-random colour assignment system implemented
- Players are now randomly assigned colours from a reverse-bag system
- This system ensures all colours are assigned before using any repeated colours
- The system also attempts to maintain an equal distribution of all colours when repeated colours are needed
- This system is independent of any randomly assigned or set colours (using the commands)
- If you only want to use this system you can simply disable the random/set commands from the config

## Todo:
- ~~Command for letting players set their own colours~~
